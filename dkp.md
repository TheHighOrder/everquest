# Dragon Killing Points
When participating in raids your character will accrue dragon killing points (DKP). Players can use their awarded DKP to bid on loot and the guild may use it to estimate player guild participation.

### DKP Mechanics
It is the goal of the guild to allow everyone to have fun, attend raids when they wish, play the characters they wish, and have a fair shot at winning loot. When necessary the guild will adjust the rules as needed to meet that goal.

DKP is tracked and managed using [OpenDKP](https://thehighorder.opendkp.com). Please refer to the [setup instuctions](#dkp-setup) and [how to bid](#how-to-bid).

### Raiding with The High Order
You may come to as many or as few raids as you wish. When raiding you must observe a few rules:
* Listen in the discord raid channel (you do not need to speak with a mic).
* Do not be /anon on raids. We want to make our presence known!
* Character must meet [minimum raid requirements](#minimum-raid-requirements).
* Actively participate in the raid.

If you are playing a character that is not your own make sure the raid leader and officers tracking the raid DKP are aware.

The guild has additional resources listed in discord for GINA, raid strategies and useful and recommended potions.

#### Off Night Raids and Special Events
Sometimes raids are organised informally or targets spawn and a raid force is assembled without prior scheduling. In general these will not use the DKP system (DKP will not be earned or used for item bids) and loot will be rolled out to all characters present. Loot rolled out should still be usable and useful to the character looting. At the guild leaders discression some of these ad-hoc raids will use the DKP system.

#### Minimum Raid Requirements
While some of the requirements are hard set by the game some of these are a soft limit. The raid leaders will allow you to join if there is room and your character is capable.

| Raid | Level Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Classic | 46 |
| Kunark | 50 |
| Fear 2.0 | 50 |
| Velious | 50 |
| Luclin | 55 |
| Planes of Power | 61 |
| Plane of Time | 64 |
| Omens of War | 65 |
| Gates of Discord | 65 |

#### Mains, Alts and Boxes
Some players like playing multiple characters at once (boxes) or switching between different characters (alts). You are allowed one designated main at a time and all your other characters in the guild will be considered alts or boxes. Alts and boxes are treated the same and are limited in how much DKP they can bid, but, are allowed to bid alongside mains.
* You must reach out to guild leadership before your first raid to have guild leadership add the "main" in game note to your character.
* You may change mains once a month. You will lose half the DKP earned on the new main; the prior main character will not lose any DKP.

Each character must:
* Meet the minimum raid requirements
* Actively participate in the raid
* Set up their own DKP

### Earning DKP
DKP is earned by showing up to and participating in guild raids. A guild leader will take raid attendance "dumps" at the start of each raid and about every 30 minutes thereafter. Players actively participating in the raid will during these times will be counted and awarded DKP.
* An extra 1 DKP will be awarded for be present at the start of the raid (the first dump).
* Up to 2 DKP may be awarded to all present the first time a raid trarget is killed. This is at the discression of guild leaders.
* DKP will be awarded for each 30 minutes in raid at the following rates for each expansion:

| Expansion | DKP per 30 minutes |
| --- | --- |
| Classic | 1 |
| Kunark | 1 |
| Velious | 2 |
| Luclin | 4 |
| Planes of Power | 8 |
| Omens of War | 10 |

#### Rules for Earning DKP
* Each character will accrue DKP individually.
* DKP cannot be transfered between characters.

### Spending DKP
There are two primary rules to using DKP.
1) Do not spend / bid DKP you have not earned.
2) DKP and items won with DKP must be used by the character that earned the DKP.

#### Rules for Spending DKP
* The character bidding must use it's own earned DKP.
* Items won with DKP cannot be givin to other characters.
* Items must be usable and useful for the character. That means the items race, class, level, and religion requirements must be met. Raid officers may allow bidding on items that are too low level that would otherwise rot.
* Do not bid more DKP than the character has earned. The DKP posted on the website is what you have available when your item drops. The DKP awarded for the current raid is not usable until it has been posted after the raid.

In the event someone bids more DKP than they have for the character the guild officers may impose a penalty taking away DKP up to double the amount that was overbid.

Characters are required to be active participants during raids are without special permission from raid officers you may not bid on items that a character was not present for.

#### Alt and Box Character DKP Bid Cap
The guilds goal is to allow main characters to have priority at highly sought after loot and allows alts and boxes to still win gear. Alts and boxes may bid with mains, but, they cannot bid more than a specified amount per item. The cap will increase with new expansions and eventually go away.

| Expansion | Cap |
| --- | --- |
| Classic | 15 |
| Kunark | 15 |
| Velious | 30 |
| Luclin | 60 |
| Planes of Power | 120 |
| Omens of War | Cap Removed |

#### Winning Loot Auctions
The character that placed a valid bid with the most DKP will win the item. If multiple bids we recieved the character will spend the second highest bid price + 1 DKP.

#### Items No One Bids On
At the discression of raid and guild leadership, when no one wins a DKP auction the item may be collected for the guild bank, or rolled out to those in attendance or even to other characters not in attendance.

#### How to Bid
Once your character has attended their first raid and completed their [DKP setup](#dkp-setup) they will be able to bid on loot using the [Open DKP Bidding Tool](https://thehighorder.opendkp.com/#/bid). Select your chacter you wish to bid with and you see see your avaialble DKP. Each item will have its own auction.

Make sure to bid as the correct character and all bids for characters other than main should bid as an alt on [OpenDKP](https://thehighorder.opendkp.com/#/bid).

### Old Items Won with DKP
As the game progresses you may have items won with DKP replaced by newer gear. Once an item is no longer useful for a character that is heirloom no drop you may give it to other characters on your account. Droppable items won with DKP have special rules at the guild leaders discression. Valuable items, worth about 10 Krono or more must be sold back to the guild for half the DKP originally spent on the item. 

Items worth under 10KR in the marketplace *may* be sold back for half DKP or kept by that player to be used as they wish for any reason (even to sell for pp). If you are interested in getting rid of a very rare or valuable item won with DKP you must consult the guild leadership.

### DKP Setup
Since DKP is tracked per charcters there are a few steps to follow for each character.

#### Before Your First Raid
Join the guild on the character and let an office know if your character is a main, alt or box. Make sure you have access to discord. Ensure that you have an account on [OpenDKP](https://thehighorder.opendkp.com).

#### After Your First Raid
Once the attendence has been added to [OpenDKP](https://thehighorder.opendkp.com) (typically within 24 hours of the raid) you will be able to claim your character. In the [characters](https://thehighorder.opendkp.com/#/characters) section find your character and in the character details claim your character. Once your claim is pending let a guild officer know and they will approve your claim. You character will show in your profile and you will be able to bid on items.

### Extras
Anyone with special needs please reach out to an officer and they will be happy to accomadate you!

DKP minuses may be given for derailing a raid or being AFK at the guid officers discression.

Do not try to game the DKP system or collude with others. The guild requires everyone work together for the collective fun and loot of the guild members.

Try to be helpful. Every progression server is an opertunity for old players to learn new tricks and new players to experience new content. Be patient and offer suggestions politely. If you are given suggestions (especially from guild leaders) please don't take it personally and try to incorperate it in your play. Long running strategy discussions are best achieved on discord and not during raids.

If you are interested in leading raids please reach out to a guild officer.
